The contents of this repository represent the starting phase of a student project aimed at constructing a replica of the AirBnB platform. In this initial phase, a backend interface, referred to as a console, has been developed to oversee the manipulation of program data. Through console commands, users can perform operations such as creation, modification, and deletion of objects, alongside managing file storage. The storage mechanism ensures persistence across sessions through the utilization of JSON serialization/deserialization.
